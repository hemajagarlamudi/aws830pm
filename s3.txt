S3 : Simple Storage Service : 

--> Object based storage : Designed to store flat data : S3
--> Block based storage : Designed to run OS : EC2 (EBS, Instance store)
--> Network based storage : Network attached storage : EFS , FSx

--> S3 is an object based storage.
--> We can store all flat files.
--> We cannot install any application / we cannot run any application.
--> S3 have unlimited storage.
--> No Pre-Provisioning required. (Pay-as-you-go)

FreeTier : 5 Gb Standard storage, 2000 PUT (upload) , 20,000 GET (Download).. Reset monthly basis..
*Practice with small docs.. pdf/notepad/images.. 

--> We store all objects in "buckets".
--> Softlimit on s3 : 100 Buckets.. We can raise tiket to aws to increase the bucket count..
--> Bucket = Folder/Dire.. With unique namespace.

Bucket Naming Limits: 
--> bucket names unique across the globe.
--> Min char 3 char.. Max 63 char..
--> No capital letters and special characters.
--> bucket name should not resemble IP address format. (Static website)
--> Name should not start with .  , should not end with . , no adjesent ..

--> Within buckts we upload objects. 
--> We can have unlimited objects in a bucket.
--> Max object size s3 supports : 5 TB.. 
--> We will get a unique URL for every object. 

Object URL syntax : 
Standard S3 Path:
https://s3.regionname.amazonaws.com/bucketname/objectname

Virtual path: (If we have . in bucket name below URL's wont work)
https://bucketname.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/objectname
https://bucketname.s3.amazonaws.com/objectname


--> We need to Open "Public Access settings" bucket level.
--> make object Public, Then the URLs works.

S3 Storage Class: 

Based on storage classes, We have Avilability and Durability. 


usecase :

Accessing Frequently 	: S3-Standard 
InFrequently accsses 	: S3 Standard-IA / OneZone-IA
Archieve 		: S3 Glacier / Glacier Deep Archieve
Non Mission critical data : RRS (Reduced Redundancy storage) : Not Recommanded
Don't know the access patterns : Intelligent Tiering


In-House : Hospital : 6-7 doctors --> Inspect the record.. : Many times /day
Heart ==> Visit at any time ==> Data needs immediately, are we accseing daily..?? 
OP : Regular ill ==> He needs prior appointment (24 Hrs) ==> Restore data (3-5 Min) (3-5 Hrs) 12-24 hrs
RRS : Logs / Thumbnails : costlier than Standrd X
Data : 
		Availability		Durability		AZs	Restore Duration

S3-Standard : 99.99% Avilability, 99.999999999 % Durability.. 	>=3 AZs
S3-Standrd IA : 99.9% Avi, 	  99.999999999 % Durability..	>=3 AZs
OneZone-IA   : 99.5% Avi, 	  99.999999999 % Durability..	1 AZs
S3 Glacier  : 99.99% Avilability, 99.999999999 % Durability.. 	>=3 AZs    (/min - /Hr)
G Deep Archi : 99.99% Avilability, 99.999999999 % Durability.. 	>=3 AZs    (/Hr)
Interlligent tier : 99.9% Avi, 	  99.999999999 % Durability..	>=3 AZs

RRS : 		99.99%		99.99%				>=3 AZ


Glacier Restore options: 
Bulk retrieval : Typically within 5-12 hours
Standard retrieval : Typically within 3 - 5 hours
Expedited retrieval : Typically within 1 - 5 minutes when retrieving less than 250MB

Versioning : 
--> Defaultly, Suspended state, We can enable. 
--> It's a backup option on our s3 buckets.
--> We can track all the changes happening on our objects.

--> Whenver  Version: HIDE, If we delete any object, we will get  delete marker.
	If we want to get the object back, Delete the DELETE MARKER.

--> Whener Version : SHOW, if we delete any object, we won;t get Delete marker. Object deletes perminantly. 


SRR / CRR :

Replication Time Control replicates 99.99% of your new objects within 15 minutes.

Task : Test the SRR.. Replicate data from Mumbai region bucket 1 --> Bucket 2.. and test the Priority on s3 buckets.

LCR : Life Cycle Management rule

Server access logging : :ogging option on our s3 bucket. THis logs enables/applicable to only this bucket. If we want to enable logging for entire s3 platform, we can use a service called "Cloudtrail".

Static website hosting: 
Bucket name = Domain Name
--> FOr our website also 99.99% availabi.
--> Performance: 3500 Write/Sec, 5500 Read/Sec..
--> http://bucketname.s3-website.region.amazonaws.com
--> Static website data , needs to have atleast read only permissions for everyone.

http Status Codes:

2XX --> Success/OK
3XX --> Redirection error
4XX --> Client side error
5xx --> Server Side error

S3 :

--> In-Transit Encryption
	--> SSL / TLS Enabled

--> Server Side Encryption (SSE) / At-Rest
	--> SSE - S3 (S3 Managed Key) : Whoever have permission on s3 , they can view.
	--> SSE - KMS (aws/s3) DMK / CMK
	--> SSE - C (Customer Provided)

--> Client Side Encryption
	--> AWS not responsible for this.
	--> If you never want to send any unencrypted data to s3. 


KMS : Key Management Service..  : 

CMK: Customer Master Key.. 

Symmetric : A single encryption key that is used for both encrypt and decrypt operations.
Asymmetric : A public and private key pair that can be used for encrypt/decrypt or sign/verify operations.

Customer managed keys : THIS WILL NOT COMES UNDER FREE TIER ELIGIBILITY..!!!


KMS : KMS Managed key.. KMS Rorates the key material.. 
KMS - C : KMS with Customer Provided Key .. Customer need to rotate the key material.. 

Key administrators: Who can administrate.. WHo can allocate permissions to another Users/services.. : Avinash_T

key usage permissions: WHo can use this key.. : Avinash_T


DMK : aws/s3: Default master key that protects my S3 objects when no other key is defined

Object Lock: 
Governance mode can be disabled by AWS accounts that have specific IAM permissions.
Compliance mode cannot be disabled by any user, including the root account.
