EC2 : Elastic 	Compute 					Cloud 
		vCPU, Memory, Storage, Network

server = Box = Instance = VMWare = Azure VM = GCP Engine
Terminate = Delete

On-Demand EC2 Instance : No specific workload / usecases.. Shortterm usage.. 
	Pricing : /Sec Basis (Min 60 Sec).. /hr basis.. 

Reserved ec2 instances (RI) : Stable workloads.. Longterm usage.. Contract 1 Yr / 3 yrs..

	Standard RI : We cannot change the configuration.. 
	Convertable RI : We can change the configuration.. 
	Scheduled RI : repeated durations

	Pricing :	Full Upfront : Pay 100% and get your instance..
			Partial upfront : Need to 30-60%.. reduce instance hrly price.. 
					   With reduced price, need to pay monthly basis
			No Upfront : Pay everything monthly basis..


Spot Instances : Flexible start/stop for our instance.. We need to BID the Pricing against AWS pricing.. 
--> We can get high configured servers at low cost..
--> Spot fleet request (Max Pricing)
--> Pricing history

==> You bid 0.50$/hr..  after 1 hr 30 Min.. 
	--> Price not increase, you terminated insatnce : 1 hr 30 Min.. : 1$
	--> Price increased by AWS, AWS Terminated insatnce : 1 hr : 0.50$

FreeTier : 750 Hours per month, t2.micro (1 vCPU, 1 RAM) , WIndows instance.. 
	750 Hours per month, t2.micro (1 vCPU, 1 RAM) , Linux instance..


AWS Marketplace : Where can buy/sell our customized appliations.. 


Instance isolation diagram
--> Tenancy:
	--> Shared tenancy / Default tenancy
	--> Dedicated tenancy : Underlying h/w will not share with any other aws cust.
		--> Dedicated instance : Small COnfig..
		--> Dedicated Host : High config to run multiple instances, More 		transparancy on CPU core level.. we can apply CPU level licenses also

Choose two regions to perform all the tasks/activities..!!
--> Mumbai
--> NV		(billing region - 6 AZs)

How to Launch a Windows ec2 instance.!! 

Step 1 : Choose an AMI (Amazon Machine Image)  : Windows Server 2016 

An AMI is a template that contains the software configuration (operating system, application server, and applications) required to launch your instance.

Step 2 : Choose the instance configuration (vCPU, Memory, Network Performance)

General purpose : Stable performance 	: t2, t3, m4, m5
Compute optimized : More CPU power 	: c4, c5, c5d, c5n
GPU Instance : Graphic performance	: P2, g4dn
Memory Optimized : More RAM perf	: r4, r5, r5d, r5ad
Storag oprimized : Best Disk perf	: d2, i2, i3
FPGA : Field programable gateway array: f1
ML ASIC : inf1

t2.micro (1 vCPU, 1 RAM) : Free Tier Eligible.. 

c5.large	: 
c5.2xlarge	: 
m5.xlarge	: 


Step 3: Configure Instance Details

No of Instance : 1
Shutdown behavior : STOP  / TERMINATE	: STOP
	What will happen when we shutdown instance from OS level : 
Enable termination protection : YES  (Secure from Accidental terminations)

Step 4: Add Storage : 30GB 

Step 5: Add Tags 
	--> max 50 tags/ instance

Step 6: Configure Security Group

Protocols to perform specific operations/ Every protocol uses a port number.. 

Windows : RDP (Remote desktop protocol) : 3389
Linux : SSH (Secure Shell) : 22
http: 80
https : 443
Mssql : 1433
mysql : 3306

RDP : TCP : 3389 : 0.0.0.0/0 ==> Everyone / anywhere

Step 7: Review Instance Launch with a KeyPair.

KeyPair : Works with Public Key and private Key mechanism (Encryption and Descryption).. 

Public Key = AWS Holds and it stores in the ec2 instance
Private Key = Given to us.. We need to browse this Privatekey against our ec2 instance to 		get the default password. (.pem format)


Public IP: Unique across the globe.. 

We need an application : RDP tool: WIndows OS defaultly avialble. 

Open "RUN" --> MSTSC (MicroSoft Terminal Services CLient) --> enter


Task 1 : Launch a WIndows ec2 instance and login with Keypair provided password.
--> Now change the "Administrator" password, close the session.. Try to login Using the keypair generated password..   Able to login with kP pwd or custom pwd..??

Task 2 : Crete another user "yourname", provide valid "Local Admin Rights" and "Remote connectivity" permissions and try to login as that user to ec2 instance. 

Task 3: Try to make your instance as webserver..!!
